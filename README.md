This is my website! I will use it as a display case for my (updated) past works. On issues, you'll read through my daily entries submitted by 6-7pm, where I review the day's work! The entry made 11/29/25 should be a base checklist for the course of this project. THIS IS DUE BY WEDNESDAY, 12/10/25.

**HONESTY POLICY:
The code for this website was assisted using Google's Gemini  AI, and various articles I will credit upon listing them out. I have copied and pasted from sites, and do not claim their work to be my own, and acknowledge AI in being a collection of stolen sources _and_ in partially aiding my coding.** This noted, I have written everything above to the most of my ability.
